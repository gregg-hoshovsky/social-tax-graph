<div id="intro" class="section">
<p>The Social Tax graph is a crowd sourcing solution that aims to remove the
congressional deadlock and giving you more of a voice. Currently we give our
money to congress in a big wad and they give it to their favorite charity,
themselves, their cronies and their lobbies. When told to control government
spending they simply take the same money for us and lower the funding for the
defense and welfare of the nation. So whether you are a Libertarian,
Republican, Tea partier, Liberal or a Progressive, we can join together and
determine how to spend that money. Use the Enter your opinion link to start.
Simply add your opinion anonymously or login to be a full participant in the
social tax graph community.</p>
